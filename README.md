## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My pronouns are he/him/his.

I'm currently a student at the University of Houston, studying for a Bachelor's of Science in CS.  
I enjoy long walks on the beach, and I'm a big fan of the color blue.  
This is basically being written by GitHub's CoPilot, so I'm not sure how much of it is actually me.

### Projects

I'm currently working on a crate for Rust that allows you to easily create your own number systems and convert between them.  
There's also the things I've worked on for the UnRaid community, which I continue to maintain.
